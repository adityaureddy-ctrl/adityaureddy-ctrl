## About me
I’m an aspiring Business Analyst with hands-on experience in SQL-based e-commerce analytics, Excel dashboarding, and financial performance analysis. I combine a business background (BBA) and professional experience at TCS with practical analytics projects to deliver data-driven insights that improve operations and revenue.

## What I work on
- **SQL analytics** for multi-table datasets (data cleaning, joins, cohort & time-series analysis)  
- **Excel & Power Query** dashboards for KPI tracking and automated reporting  
- **Financial performance analysis** integrating SQL extracts with Excel visualisations  
- **HR & Operations analytics** — attrition and workforce insights    
- **Stakeholder-driven solutions**: translating data into action and presentations for decision-makers

## Key Projects (click repos pinned on my profile)
### 1) `olist-sql-analysis` — E-commerce SQL analytics (Olist dataset)
**Tools:** SQL (DBeaver/MySQL)  
**Objective:** Explore orders, delivery performance and customer behaviour across multiple tables.  
**Highlights / Results:** Identified category & region-level delivery delay patterns; suggested targeted seller interventions with a potential ~10% reduction in late shipments.  
**How to run:** See `README.md` in repo — includes SQL scripts and sample outputs.

### 2) `Superstore-sales-analysis-Project-Excel` — Sales & Performance Dashboard (Excel)
**Tools:** Excel (Power Query, PivotTables, charts)  
**Objective:** Build interactive dashboard to track product sales, revenue, and regional KPIs.  
**Highlights / Results:** Automated weekly reporting pipeline and enabled clearer identification of underperforming SKUs for management.  
**Notes:** Dashboard screenshot and sample workbook in `/assets`.

### 3) `Finance-Performance-Dashboard` — Combined SQL + Excel financial analysis
**Tools:** SQL, Excel  
**Objective:** Integrate raw transaction data with Excel to compute margins, cost drivers and monthly variance analysis.  
**Highlights / Results:** Found a 12% cost variance in specific months; recommended cost-center optimizations & product focus.  
**How to run:** SQL extract scripts + Excel workbook with pivot-ready tables.

### 4) `Employee-Attrition-Analytics-PowerBI` — Employee Attrition Analysis & Dashboard (Power BI)  
**Tools:** Power BI, DAX, Excel (for pre-processing), SQL (for extracts)  
**Objective:** Analyze employee attrition drivers, identify high-risk cohorts, and build an interactive dashboard for HR stakeholders.  
**Highlights / Results:** Built a retention-risk model using tenure, performance rating, business unit and compensation bands; visualized attrition hotspots by team and month. Recommendations included targeted retention initiatives for identified high-risk cohorts (e.g., targeted career-pathing for mid-tenure high performers).
